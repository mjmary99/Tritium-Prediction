# Prediction of the Distribution of Tritium Over the Pacific Ocean from Fukushima Wastewater Until 2090


The Fukushima nuclear wastewater release into the Pacific Ocean, starting August 25th,
7 2023, has prompted global concerns. This project, the first of its kind, investigates the
8 distribution of tritium radioactive particles and assesses their impact on the U.S. west
9 coast. Utilizing IAEA monitor, ECCO currents, and AOML drifter data, the model sim-
10 ulates tritium movement, revealing its arrivals at the U.S. coast. Potential adjustments
11 to U.S. power plant emissions are considered, with the first wave reaching Hawaii in the
12 5th year and U.S. coastal regions experiencing subsequent waves post-2033. Adjustments
13 aim to mitigate potential west coast Pacific overload.
